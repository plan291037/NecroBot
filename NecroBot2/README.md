## Getting Started
### Download
Download the bot from the [release](https://github.com/Necrobot-Private/NecroBot/releases) tab.  
If you want the latest Beta-Build, you have to download the build from the Beta-Build branch and compile them by yourself with VisualStudio 2015.   
**Waning: Beta-Builds are unstable and might cause damage to your account, use at your own risk**
### Login
There are problems with google oauth login, so we have to use account and password to login for now.  
To ensure your account's safety, we suggest you to creat an app password just for botting. This will also allows users with 2-fact-auth enable to use the bot.  
Tutorial on how to use app password: [Google support](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en)
### Settings
Change your settings using the settings tab on the bot. If you want more advance settings, edit the settings file under the bot's folder.
### Wola
Click Start Bot and enjoy!
